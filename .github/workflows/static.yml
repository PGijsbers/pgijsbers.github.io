# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
# The current workflow also allows up to one preview branch,
# which is whatever branch is pushed (if it is not master)
# This is a bit finicky, but I don't expect to need more than
# one preview at a time at the moment, so it will do.
# It would be nicer if I could just "add" to the artifact instead.
