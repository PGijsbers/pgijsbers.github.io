        <h1>Rewriting my site... again</h1>
        <p>
            This is the fourth time I have started to rewrite my website in equally many years.
            Let me explain why.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Why I am writing my own site</h3>
        <p>
            When I made my first web page, in 2020, I did not have any experience with web development.
            For that reason, I simply chose an open source template that I liked the design of and tweaked it.
            <sup><a href="#footnote-1-text" id="footnote-1-location">1</a></sup>
            However, I wanted to change more than just the text or hero image on that page.
            I also wanted to change the design of some sections, re-arrange others, and ensure it was functional without Javascript.
            This proved difficult, as I now had to navigate large HTML files that were primarily styled by
            classes from style sheets large enough to warrant their own table of content,
            using pseudo-classes and media queries,
            and backed up by various Javascript functionality, all while never haven written a basic website before.
            <sup><a href="#footnote-2-text" id="footnote-2-location">2</a></sup>
            While in the end I managed to make the changes I wanted, it often took longer than I wanted to,
            and I did not really feel like I learned much in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when I came back to update my page 2 years later, I knew I had to make a change.
            I was going to build my own site. A site I would understand, could easily modify,
            and, just as important, allow me to build a gradual understanding of the basic building blocks of the web.
            The result was a placeholder website that looked worse and took me longer to build
            than adjusting the template would have.
            But I understood every bit of it, the site was fast(er), and building it was fun.
        </p>

        <h3>Replacing my placeholder</h3>
        <p>
            The major problem with projects is that they are much easier to start than to finish.
            The "first" placeholder page I wrote stayed up for a whole year.
            When I did finally get around to replacing it, I at least finished the frontpage and the 'about' page.
            I did use some AI art which was intended to be a placeholder but, you guessed it, I never got around to replacing it.
            It also had a really annoying <a href="issue_link">visual bug</a> I could not figure out.
            But I did improve my understanding of HTML/CSS, as well as optimizations like subsetting fonts, preloading, and image compression.
            All in all, a fairly good local optimum to let things be for a while.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>The page that never was</h3>
        <p>
            Another year or so passed and I had learned CSS animations exist.
            I had already considered getting rid of my front page images altogether,
            both for optimization and because I did not want to use AI images any longer,
            so I figured I replace them with animations.
            To keep a long story short, I took too big a bite and couldn't finish
            my project in the time I had for it. I decided to cut my losses and get back
            to contributing to OpenML and the AutoML benchmark.
            The site never went live, but at least I did write my first CSS animations
            and played around with the GitHub GraphQL API.

        <h3>My latest website</h3>
        <p>
            And now you are reading this post on the site I wrote when I got yet another itch.
            This time I was a little more deliberate though: I kept the scope small,
            and largely confined to concepts I was already familiar with.
            But I also knew I will want to keep experimenting with things in the future.
            For that reason I made sure include a blog section.
            The next time I have an itch, I'll write a single page, it can be a simple demo,
            and it doesn't have to be a multi-page responsive website.
